Go through the whole code-base thoroughly first.

Goal: Build a modern, dark-themed, responsive Resume Analyzer UI similar to an AI resume analysis dashboard.
This task is front-end only — do not modify or connect to backend logic.

Requirements:

Do not touch backend — focus purely on HTML, CSS, and JS for UI/UX.

Create (or update) these files:

index.html

style.css

script.js

General Style & Layout:

Use a dark theme (navy / midnight background) with purple-blue accents.

Modern, minimal, professional look (rounded cards, subtle shadows, animations).

Use Google Fonts like Poppins or Inter.

All sections should be centered and responsive (flex or grid layout).

Page Sections
1. Header

App Title: Resume Scorer

Subtitle: “AI-Powered Resume Analysis & Job Matching”

Right-aligned buttons for Dark/Light Mode toggle and Help (?).[Help can have some basic knowledge about using the application]

2. Upload Section (Initial View)

A card or section titled “Upload Your Resume” with description text:

“Upload your resume and job description to get detailed analysis.”

Elements:

Drag-and-drop area or Upload button (Choose Resume PDF)

File name display after upload

Text area or card for Job Description input

Analyze Resume button (large, gradient-styled)

3. Analysis Section (Visible after clicking Analyze)

4. New Analysis Button

 Technical Notes

Use Chart.js for visualizations.

Use vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (no frameworks).

Add smooth fade-in/out animations when switching between views.

Include all CSS in style.css (no inline styles).

Maintain semantic, well-structured HTML with descriptive class names.

Keep everything mobile-friendly with responsive layouts.

Optional: Add a simple light/dark mode toggle (CSS-based).


End Goal:
A clean, modern, front-end–only Resume Analyzer interface with:

Upload + Analyze (initial view)

Results dashboard with charts, strengths, and improvements

“New Analysis” reset button returning to initial state
